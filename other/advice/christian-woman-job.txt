The job of a christian woman as a wife (her role in this planet) is to be a “Help Meet” (their role in the planet is a man, not her career, not her job).
	>that means she had a job to do, she's supposed to help him tend to the garden
Not to come and go as her wish, not to have that kind of freedom.
Is not about partnership or being her friend (is not in the bible), the man have headship over her.

The women (feminist/modern type) want christian men but don't want to live in the order the divinity in which god align us.

Love is not the purpuse of marriage is duty and responsability.
	>duty from wife to her husband and from husband to his wife, that's what vows are for
		>duty requires you to be selfless, requires you to hold yourself to a higher standard that the rest of the world that's fallen
		>the church supposed to be the light
	>those aren't suggestions
	>you get married for practical reasons children, legacy, etc (sipiritual reasons also)
		>and eventually you fell in love with your spouse

Romantic love and agape love (the highest form of love, of God for man and of man for God) have been completely screwed up in the church.
The church never was about romantic love, it was always about god faith. You didn't talk about love in arranged marriages, love came later.
	>that's why so many men are no longer in church, because they're tired of hearing christian women speaking in contravening to christianity
	>women need to be put in the position to be found by their husband
		>not putting pressure in not being married yet, is not helping women
		
The top 1% work 10, 12, 16 hours a day
	>they get a wife usually by matchmakers (they're not in dating apps)
	>but hey are in whole foods
	
At the end of the day, independence, equality, feminism... is giving women the opportunity to fail.
Life is about people and relationships, god didn't tell us to not fruitful and multiply.
We're supposed to be together.
