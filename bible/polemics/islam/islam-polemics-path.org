* Recommendations

- When a muslim get upset about insulting Muhammad, remmind them that you are only describing his behavior from their own sources.
  + Remark the difference between Holy an Unholy, is like good & bad, clean & unclean (then the examples).
- The best way to get someone busted is to let him talk directly, so he cannot retrieve later (with the excuse 'he not say that').
- Talk to someone who behave like an adult not a kid.
- If you mention a topic you stay with it (same for the opponent).
- Don't waste your time with people who ask the same question always, their purpose is to distract you from exposing Islam.

* Refutal

- *In response of:* Any claim about Christianity or the Bible without sources
  + *The answer:* There's a standard asnwer to not waste your time

  Give us reliable sources (scholars, books, chapter->pages) to back up your claims, not your opinion, not your sheikh opinion, or the lazy "just Google it"

- *In response of:* Christians using the Quran to criticize and make claims
  + *The answer:* Muslims believe the Bible & Torah are corrupted, so if I make a point you wouldn't believe that
