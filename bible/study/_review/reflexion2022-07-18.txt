Duty & respect, comes before love. love comes later.

Women are more free, but less happy.
When you become elevated in position, life doesn't become easier (or happier).
With freedom, you get more responsabilities.

Marriage (or our job for example) isn't suppose to make you happy.
The job of a woman is to support the man and happiness comes with relationships and things like that.

Submission requires good faith and humility.
There is a peacefulness that comes with women who submit.

People who are humble, don't have a lot of impatience or low tolerance for people.

Careers are for outcomes
	>women sometimes comes from a place projecting fear, scarsity and lack
		>that's why they need their career and everything else, because what if their marriage didn't work, etc, etc

As a man you're number 1,
your purpose is number 2
your woman is number 3.

hombres y mujeres tienen un rol
las acciones hablan mas fuerte que las palabras
