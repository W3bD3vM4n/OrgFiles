* Data base design phase

** Basics

ERD is a graphical representation of the data requirements.
- Acts like blueprints for a building (the data base)

- It's recommended for entities with large columns to create new entities

- There's a difference between columns and data.
  + Columns are the entity's attribute, it's a constant
  + Data is the column's content, it's a variable

*** Crow's foot notation
The easiest way to represent cardinality in a diagram.

| Symbol | Meaning              |
|--------+----------------------|
| ----┼- | One                  |
|        |                      |
| -----< | Many                 |
|        |                      |
| ----╫- | Only One (mandatory) |
|        |                      |
| ----┼< | One/Many (mandatory) |
|        |                      |
| ---o┼- | Zero/One (optional)  |
|        |                      |
| ----o< | Zero/Many (optional) |

- The mandatory/optional refers to the minimum.
- The one/many refers to the maximum.


** Definitions

- *Entity*: represents a person, place, or thing to track in the data base (the table).
- *Attribute*: describes various characteristics about an individual entity (the columns).
- *Primary Key*: an attribute that uniquely identifies an instance of the entity.
- *Relationship*: describe how an entity interact with each other.
- *Cardinality*: the count (minimum/maximum) of necessary instances.

- *One mandatory*: it must have at least one instance (only).
- *Many mandatory*: it must have at least one but you can have several.
- *One optional*: an instance is optional but only one.
- *Many optional*: an instance is optional but there's not limit.
