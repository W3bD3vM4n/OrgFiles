- Lisp (LISt Processing) handles _lists_
  + which represent data and programs in the same way
    - one program may easily serve as data for another

- A list:
  + is a program ready to run (evaluate with ~C-x C-e~)
    - treat the first symbol as a command (function) to do something
  + mark the boundaries with parentheses
    - contain words, numbers, or other lists
  + separate the elements (atoms) with whitespace

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (+ 2 2)

#+end_src

- An apostrophe ‘'’ (single-quote) ahead means, *do nothing*
  + the evaluation display the content as it's written

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    '(this is a quoted list)

#+end_src
