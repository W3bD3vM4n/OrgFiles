- Lists are the basis of Lisp.
  + it handles _lists_
    - mark their boundaries with parentheses
    - separate elements with whitespace
    - an apostrophea ‘'’ follow a list between another
      + it tells Lisp to do nothing with the list

  + any list is a program ready to run (evaluate)
    1. do nothing except return to you the list itself
    2. send you an error message
    3. treat the first symbol in the list as a command to do something
